# Assigns start and endpoint range for CDR2s in Heavy Chain Sequences according to Kabat and Chothia rules for antibody numbering
# to find CDR2s in Heavy Chain Sequences. 
#Since there is greater variance, Gives APPROXIMATE region based on average of AbM And Chothia minimum and maximum lengths.

# Cutting off 7 residues earlier, according to AbM and Chothia, but taking Kabat 16 to 19 residues and subtracting 7 from each and taking average.
